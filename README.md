# `blame-jump.nvim`

This is a plugin for showing the git changes (`git show`) for the current line in a temporary buffer and adding the navigation to the tag stack.

This is basically a combination of tpope's Fugitive `:G blame` command and LSP [g]o to [d]efinition so that the navigation is added to the tag stack and the user can jump back to their previous location with `<c-t>`.
